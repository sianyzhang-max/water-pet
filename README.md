#**💧 Water Pet (ADHD Friendly Hydration)**

A healing companion for ADHD brains, built hand-in-hand with AI.
Because sometimes, we all need a little help to take care of ourselves.

#**About**

Water Pet is a gamified, minimalist water tracker designed specifically for ADHD brains. We know that standard notifications are easily ignored, and executive dysfunction can make self-care feel like a chore. That's why this app turns hydration into a game of "taking care of a pet"—because sometimes, it's easier to care for a cute blob than for ourselves.

#**My First Coding Journey with AI**

This project holds a deeply personal meaning: **it is my very first time writing code.**

Starting from zero, the process was filled with unknown challenges and technical hurdles. However, AI acted not just as a tool, but as a patient mentor and constant source of encouragement. It guided me to discover bugs, understand errors, and solve problems one by one.

From the fluid physics of the water blob to the empathetic logic of the mood clinic, every line of code represents a lesson learned. This project is proof that with curiosity and the right support, anyone can build something healing and beautiful.

#**Key Features**

Interactive Desktop Pet: A "living" fluid blob that reacts to your actions. It gets sad (pink) when thirsty and happy (bright blue) when hydrated.

AI-Powered Motivation: Integrated with Google Gemini API to generate unique, funny, and warm reminders. No more boring, repetitive notifications!

Mood Clinic: Feeling off? Tell the Water Spirit how you feel, and the AI will analyze if you're dehydrated or just need a hug.

Dopamine-Focused Design: Satisfying sound effects, confetti animations, and instant visual feedback to keep you engaged.

Mini Mode: One-click transformation into a small, unobtrusive widget that sits on your screen while you work.

Offline Support: Works perfectly without an API key using a built-in library of motivational quotes.

#**Tech Stack**
